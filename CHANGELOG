== 0.9.1

- Change Object.create to Object.extend to avoid collision with ES5
- Use of defineProperty in modern browsers to prevent enumeration in for..in loops.
- Add test for for..in loop breakage and allowed older browsers to have a "warning" message.
- Object.isArray will now alias native Array.isArray if it is present.
