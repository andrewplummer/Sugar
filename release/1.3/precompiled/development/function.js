     * @method lazy([ms] = 1, [limit] = Infinity)
     * @returns Function
     * @short Creates a lazy function that, when called repeatedly, will queue execution and wait [ms] milliseconds to execute again.
     * @extra Lazy functions will always execute as many times as they are called up to [limit], after which point subsequent calls will be ignored (if it is set to a finite number). Compare this to %throttle%, which will execute only once per [ms] milliseconds. %lazy% is useful when you need to be sure that every call to a function is executed, but in a non-blocking manner. Calling %cancel% on a lazy function will clear the entire queue. Note that [ms] can also be a fraction.
     * @example
     *
     *   (function() {
     *     // Executes immediately.
     *   }).lazy()();
     *   (3).times(function() {
