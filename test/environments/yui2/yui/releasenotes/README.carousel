Carousel Release Notes

*** version 2.8.0 ***

* IMPORTANT CHANGE: Beginning with this release, the widget requires the
  dimensions (both height and width) of a single Carousel item.

  e.g.
  
  .yui-carousel-element li {
      height: XXX;
      width: XXX;
  }
  
* Changed the implementation to use absolute positioning instead of float for
  the Carousel list items.  This change makes the component set raw styles to
  the Carousel items instead of just styling the element only through CSS.
* Added multi-row support.
* Added pagination template support.
* Added support for reverse lazy loading of items.
* Added new methods replaceItem(), replaceItems().
* Fixed bug where carousel was stealing focus from form fields.
* Added anchor support for pager/pagination buttons (for SEO).
* Code cleanup.

*** version 2.7.0 ***

* Important change - nav elements should be BUTTONS for receiving focus
        for accessibility.
* Make the Carousel list element, and item element configurable.
* Added helper methods like isAutoPlayOn(), isAnimating().
* Fixed bugs related to computing the container width.
* Changed the ambiguous "autoPlay" attribute name to "autoPlayInterval".
* Code cleanup.

*** version 2.6.0 ***

* Initial release.
