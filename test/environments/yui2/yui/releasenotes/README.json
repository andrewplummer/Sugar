JSON Utility - Release Notes

Development master
2.8.0
    * Refactored to be ECMA 5 spec compliant.  This resulted in the following:
        * Leverages browser native JSON parse and stringify if present
        * Added JSON.useNativeParse and JSON.useNativeStringify boolean configs to
          allow implementers to force the use of the JavaScript implementation.
          These are defaulted to true when the current browser supports native
          JSON.  It is currently recommended to set useNativeStringify to false if
          you need to use a replacer function.
        * Removed object key sorting (per spec)
        * Stringifying cyclical objects will now throw an error (per spec)
        * Removed support for depth control (per spec)
    * Tightened up JSON.stringToDate
    * Renamed final regex _INVALID => _UNSAFE because the destructive regex
      process is to detect unsafe input.  It does not validate against JSON
      syntax.
    * Refactored stringify to match the implementation in YUI 3.
